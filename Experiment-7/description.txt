Experiment 7 â€“ React Product Cards

Objective:
Create a simple React app that displays a list of products using reusable components and props.

Overview:
This experiment demonstrates building a small React interface composed of a parent list component and a reusable card component. The parent component renders a collection of products by mapping over an array and passing data to each card via props. Inline styles are used for quick presentation.

Key Files:
- src/App.jsx: Boots the app and renders the products list component.
- src/productcard.jsx: Defines ProductCard (reusable UI) and ProductsList (maps products to cards).
- src/App.css and other Vite boilerplate files.

Tech Stack:
- React (Vite scaffolding)
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- ESLint (basic config)

Features Demonstrated:
- Component composition (parent-child relationship)
- Passing data using props
- Rendering lists with Array.map
- Basic inline styling

How to Run:
1) Open a terminal in this folder.
2) Install dependencies: npm install
3) Start dev server: npm run dev
4) Open the URL printed in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

Possible Extensions:
- Load products from an API or JSON file
- Add search/filter and sorting
- Replace inline styles with CSS modules or a CSS framework
- Add interactivity (e.g., add to cart, stock badges)
